# Analyze-Celebrity-Deaths
In this project, I analyze  data  from  the  file  “celebrity_deaths_2016.xlsx”  which contains  records  of  deaths  of  famous  humans  and  non-humans  in  2016.    

I use  functions from  the  pandas  module  for  loading,  inspecting  and  querying  data.  I successfully summarize data, create pivot tables and apply aggregate functions, and to visualize data using 
histograms and other kinds of plots.
